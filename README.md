# House Price Regression Analysis 🏡📈

This project involves analyzing and predicting house prices in Tehran using various regression models. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and evaluation of multiple regression techniques.

## Project Overview

- 📊 **Data Loading and Inspection**: Loading and exploring the dataset, identifying and handling missing values, and inspecting the data for outliers.
- 🧹 **Data Cleaning**: Removing outliers and transforming columns for consistency.
- 🛠️ **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features to improve model performance.
- 🤖 **Model Training and Evaluation**: Implementing and evaluating multiple regression models, including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Decision Tree Regression
  - Random Forest Regression
  - Gradient Boosting Regression
  - Polynomial Regression

## Data

- 📍 The dataset used in this analysis is `housePrice.csv`, which contains information on house prices and related features in Tehran.

## Results

- 📈 The evaluation of different regression models includes metrics such as R² score and Mean Squared Error (MSE). Due to the relatively small size of the dataset, the model performance scores may not be very high. The results provide insights into the performance of each model in predicting house prices given the current data constraints.

## 🚀 Future Work 

- 🌍 **Expand Analysis to New Regions**: Apply the regression models to house price data for California or other regions to validate and compare results.
- 🔍 **Explore Advanced Techniques**: Investigate more advanced machine learning techniques and model tuning for improved predictions.
- 📊 **Integrate Additional Features**: Incorporate more features such as neighborhood data, economic indicators, and property conditions.
